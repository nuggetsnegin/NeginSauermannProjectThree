Quirky click or touch game where you have to find where the cat likes being pet in under 30 seconds! Features randomized petting spots as well as random cats(including Garfield)! Built with JavaScript, JQuery, HTML and CSS.

## Built With

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Stretch Goals
* Accessibility - currently requires a mouse on Desktop and is not fully accessible. Potential solution is to change game area from CSS Grid to map for the cat body to deal with tabbing/focus.
* Leaderboard - implement a leaderboard system where user's best time is saved in a database (Firebase).
