## Stretch Goals
* Accessibility - currently requires a mouse on desktop and is not fully accessible. Potential solution is to change game area from CSS Grid to map for the cat body to deal with tabbing/focus.
* Leaderboard - implement a leaderboard system where user's best time is saved in a database (Firebase).
